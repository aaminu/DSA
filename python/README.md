# Intro
All data structure and algo are written in python (Python 3.9). Tests are also written for each script, and can be found in the test folder.

## Setup
1. It would be nice to use a virtual enviroment and as such, a requirement.txt file is included.  
2. Navigate to the python folder using your terminal/commandline
3. In your terminal (Mac, Linux), use the following command
    ```bash
    $ python -m venv venv
    $ source  venv/bin/activate
    (venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. In windows, replace ``` source venv/bin/activate``` with  ``` source venv/Scripts/activate```
